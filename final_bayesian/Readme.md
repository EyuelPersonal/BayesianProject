To run our code please complete the following:

With a python environment >=3.9 run the following command in the project root folder:

python3 -m pip install requirements.txt

Go into the notebook "Final_Bayesian_notebook.ipynb" and select the kernel you ran the pip install to run the notebook code.

Running all cells should run the whole code base seamlessly.

You may want to reduce the tuning and sampling parameters in the "pm.sample" methods to reduce the runtime of the overall notebook.
